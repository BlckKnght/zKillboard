		<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h5>I posted my personal API but my kills didn't show up!!! Where are they?!</h5>
				API will only post kills in which you are the final blow.  If someone else you were flying with got the final blow then they need to post their API.  However, the API will always post your losses.  Also keep in mind that personal (Character) api's only go back to the last 25 kills/losses.  Beyond that CCP doesn't provide any more history.</li>
			<li><h5>I posted a corporation API key and yet some kills are still missing.  Why?</h5>
				If a member of the corporation didn't get the final blow then your corp API won't have a record of the kill.  The corp API will return all losses by corp members.  Corporation API's only go back to the last 100 kills/losses.</li>
			<li><h5>Why can't I share my API on multiple killboards?</h5>
					One Character.  One Key.  One Killboard.<br/><br/>Unfortunately CCP doesn't have a proper caching scheme when it comes to pulling kills with their API.  If multiple killboards attempt to pull the information only the first killboard to pull will get a result, the others will get a 119 error code.  It doesn't matter if you create multiple API keys for the same character, the same problem will persist.  There is nothing we can do about this.<br/><br/>For corporations this problem is easy to get around: Use multiple directors and have them each create a key for a killboard.  For example: Bossman [CEO] could create an API key that he posts on zKB, then Bossman's Minion [Director] could create an API key to use on a personal killboard.</li>
