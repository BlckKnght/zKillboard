<h2>zKillboard - Payments</h2>
<hr/>
You can make payments to zKillboard that will remove ads when you are logged in.<br/>
You can be ad free on zKillboard.com and all subdomains when they are implemented Soon(TM).<br/><br/>
<div class="alert alert-info"><em>You MUST have an API registered with us that has the character you're sending ISK from - or we won't know who is sending us the ISK!<br/>This API must be tied to your account as well... click <a href='/account/api/'>here</a> to see API tied to your account.</em></div>
Each month of ad free time costs {{ adFreeMonthCost|number_format(2) }} ISK. <br/>
Each 6 months you purchase will give you a bonus month.<br/><br/>
To make a payment send ISK to the character <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/93382481/">zKillboard</a>, or use this handy in game link: <a href="#" onClick="CCPEVE.showInfo(1377, 93382481);">zKillboard</a>.<br/><br/>
The wallet is checked approximately every 35 minutes.<br/>
